# Bayesian-Statistics

This checkpoint is designed to test your understanding of applying Bayes' theorem.

Specifically, this will cover:

Interpreting a word problem and applying Bayes' theorem
Manipulating the elements of Bayes' theorem to a given problem context
Your Task: Calculate Probabilities Using Bayes' Theorem

Problem Context

Thomas is going to get a new puppy. There are two major decisions involved: what location he gets the puppy from, and what size the puppy is.

The possible locations for getting the puppy are the pet store or the pound. These are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive probabilities, meaning that Thomas will only go to one location, and there is a 100% probability that he will go to one of these two locations. We'll represent those probabilities as  and  as needed.

The possible puppy sizes are small, medium, or large. Again, these are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive probabilities, so a given puppy has only one size and there is a 100% probability that Thomas will get a puppy with one of these three sizes. We'll represent those probabilities as , , and  as needed.
